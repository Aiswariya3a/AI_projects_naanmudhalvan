Certainly, here's a template for a README file for your spam classifier project:

```markdown
# Spam Classifier Project

## Overview
This project is aimed at building a spam classifier to differentiate between spam and non-spam (ham) messages. It involves preprocessing text data, feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed to run the code:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- NumPy

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

## Dataset
- Dataset Source: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
- Description: The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as 'ham' (non-spam) and 'spam'. It is provided in a CSV format.

## Instructions
1. Download the dataset (spam.csv) from the provided Kaggle source or specify your own dataset.
2. Clone this project repository to your local machine or download the code files.

### Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset into your preferred data analysis environment.
- Run the data_preprocessing.py script to clean and preprocess the data. This script will handle missing values, duplicates, and apply text-specific preprocessing.

```bash
python data_preprocessing.py
```

### Model Training
- After preprocessing, you can train the spam classifier.
- Run the model_training.py script to train the model using a Naive Bayes classifier and TF-IDF features.

```bash
python model_training.py
```

### Model Evaluation
- Finally, evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- Run the model_evaluation.py script to generate a confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.

```bash
python model_evaluation.py
```

## Results
You will find the model's performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, in the terminal output after running the model_evaluation.py script.
